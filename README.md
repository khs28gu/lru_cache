## LRU Cache Practice Example

This is a simple LRU cache using a linked hash map (dictionary) and
doubly linked list written in Python 3.

Right now the LRUCache can not be persisted. A simple solution could be built using
shelves - which would pickle the cache object and store it in a db file.
A better solution would be to use some form of memory cache.
